# Isomorphic npm Portlet

**Important:** This sample works for Liferay DXP Fix Pack 30+ and Liferay Portal
CE GA5+.

The Isomorphic npm Portlet sample provides a portlet that uses
[isomorphic](http://isomorphic.net/) code to render its output. Note that this
portlet does not run JavaScript code in the server; it's executing isomorphic
JavaScript code in the browser.

For more details on this sample, see the
[Isomorphic npm Portlet](https://dev.liferay.com/develop/reference/-/knowledge_base/7-0/isomorphic-npm-portlet)
article on Liferay's Developer Network.
