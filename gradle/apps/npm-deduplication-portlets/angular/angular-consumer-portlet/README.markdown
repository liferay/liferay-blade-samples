# Angular Consumer Portlet

**Important:** This sample works for Liferay DXP Fix Pack 44+ and Liferay Portal
CE GA7+.

The Angular Consumer Portlet sample provides a portlet that uses the
deduplicated instance of the [Angular](https://angular.io/) framework, provided
by the Angular Provider sample, to render its output.
