# Language

This sample module is one of two modules in the Shared Language Keys project
used to demonstrate how to share language keys using OSGi services. This
particular sample provides a resource module which only holds language keys. The
other module required for this demonstration is the
[`language-web`](../language-web) module.

For more details explaining how the `language` and
`language-web` modules function together, see the following
