# Angular Provider

**Important:** This sample works for Liferay DXP Fix Pack 44+ and Liferay Portal
CE GA7+.

The Angular Provider sample provides an OSGi bundle that provides a deduplicated
instance of the [Angular](https://angular.io/) framework for portlets to share
when rendering their output.

For more details on this sample, see the
[Angular Provider](https://dev.liferay.com/develop/reference/-/knowledge_base/7-0/angular-provider)
article on Liferay's Developer Network.
