# Model Listener

## What does this sample do when it's deployed?

The Model Listener sample demonstrates adding a custom model listener to a
Liferay Portal's out of the box entity. When deploying this sample with no
customizations, a custom model listener will be added to `layouts`, listening
for `onBeforeCreate` events. This means that any page creation will trigger this
listener, which will execute before the new page being created.

As an example, having this module deployed and started in a running Liferay DXP
installation, if a new page is added with the name `My Test Page`, the following
message should be printed to the standard output:

It should be also possible to verify that the  model listener sample was
executed by going to the `SEO` tab on the `Configure Page` option, where the
`HTML Title` should be the following:

## What API(s) and/or code components does this sample highlight?

This sample leverages the
[Model Listeners](https://dev.liferay.com/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/7-0/model-listeners)
extension point.

## How does this sample leverage the API(s) and/or code component?

Model Listeners can be used to listen for persistence events on models and take
actions as a result of those events. Actions can be executed before or after a
create, remove, update, addAssociation and removeAssociation events, on an
entity's database table. It's important to bear in mind that it's possible to
have more than one model listener on a single model and the execution order is
not guaranteed.

To create a new model listener, there are two main steps that need to be done:

- Implement a `Model Listener` class
- Register the new service in Liferay’s OSGi runtime

This sample is adding the model listener logic in a new Java class named
`CustomLayoutListener`, that extends `BaseModelListener`.

	public class CustomLayoutListener extends BaseModelListener<Layout> {

		@Override
		public void onBeforeCreate(Layout model) throws ModelListenerException {
			System.out.println(
				"About to create layout: " + model.getNameCurrentValue());
	
			model.setTitle("Title generated by model listener!");
		}
	
	}

Important things to note on the previous snippet are:

- The entity to be targeted by this model listener should be specified on the
parameterized type (E.g. `Layout`)
- The overridden methods will dictate the type of event(s) that should be listen
to (E.g. `onBeforeCreate`), and which should trigger the logic execution

Final step is registering the service in Liferay’s OSGi runtime, which is
accomplished by the following annotation (if using Declarative Services):

	@Component(immediate = true, service = ModelListener.class)
